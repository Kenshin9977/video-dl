# Privacy Policy — Video-dl

**Last updated:** 2026-02-28

## Overview

Video-dl is an open-source video downloading and encoding application. We respect your privacy and are committed to transparency about how the app works.

## Data Collection

Video-dl **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data**. Specifically:

- **No analytics or tracking** — we do not use any analytics SDK
- **No accounts or registration** — the app works entirely offline
- **No crash reporting** — no data is sent when errors occur
- **No advertising** — the app contains no ads or ad SDKs

## Data Stored Locally

The app stores the following data **only on your device**:

- **Configuration file** — your preferences (download format, output directory, language)
- **Downloaded files** — saved to your chosen download directory

This data never leaves your device.

## Network Access

The app connects to the internet **only** to:

- Download videos from URLs you provide
- Check for app updates (desktop only)

No other network requests are made.

## Third-Party Services

The app uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to extract video information from URLs you provide. This involves standard HTTP requests to the video hosting platforms — the same as visiting those sites in a browser.

## Children's Privacy

The app does not knowingly collect any data from anyone, including children.

## Changes

If this policy changes, the updated version will be published in the app's source repository.
